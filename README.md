# Web Development: Let's Break it Down

## Development Tools

Web browsers come with built-in developer tools.
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) right-click on any web page and inspect element

Online code editors for prototyping, demos, experiments, hacks.
- [Codepen](http://codepen.io/)

Local editors to build larger apps and sites with code across multiple files.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)

Version Control Systems record changes to source files. Useful when building applications over time or with collaborators.
- Git is bundled with the GitHub App for [Windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [Mac](https://mac.github.com/)

Code hosting makes it easy to share code with others. These also come with collaboration tools: branches, pull requests & issues.

## HTML
Web pages are written in Hyper Text Markup Language, abbreviated as HTML. This HTML code contains the text content of the page.

Other files can be references, such as images or videos.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Easy does it</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    This is a totally legit web page.
  </body>
</html>
```

HTML adds structure to the content, like titles, sections, footers, etc. This code is called a tag. Most tags have and an opening and a closing surrounding their text content. Tags can also have attributes that contain extra information for the browser.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
<a href="https://ninja.sg/">I am a link.</a>

## CSS
Adding design and layout to web pages is done using Cascading Style Sheets, aka CSS. This is a different language better suited to describe what the HTML elements should looks like.
